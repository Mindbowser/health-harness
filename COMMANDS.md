# Commands — who does what, when (mapped to Agile/SDLC)

> The harness **does not replace Scrum/Agile** — every command slots into a ceremony you already run.
> This is the day-one reference: which command, in which ceremony, who drives it, what it produces.

## View A — Command reference (with SDLC/Agile phase)

| # | Command | Agile ceremony / SDLC phase | Frequency | Who drives | How invoked | What it does | Produces |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `/role` | Personal setup / *pre-work* | Once per person | Each person | **type** | Set your persona (`pm`/`engineer`) — decides your default `/align` mode (AUTHOR vs BUILD-PREP) | `~/.health-harness/role` |
| – | `/harness-help` | Any time / *onboarding* | As needed | Anyone | **type** | Show the in-plugin guide (what the harness is + how to use it) — works without repo access | an overview |
| 1 | `/start` | Project onboarding / *Inception* | Once per repo | Engineer/lead | **type** | Detect new vs existing repo, ensure compliance profile, route to a front door | routes to #2 or #3 |
| 2 | `/scaffold-from-boilerplate` | Project onboarding / *Inception* | Once (new repo) | Engineer/lead | agent (via `/start`) | Clone MB boilerplate, wire the gate, set the profile | a ready new repo |
| 3 | `/onboard-existing-codebase` | Project onboarding / *Inception* | Once (existing repo) | Engineer | agent (via `/start`) | Read repo → write `CLAUDE.md`; **confirm/create a test gate (hard gate)** | repo `CLAUDE.md` + gate |
| 4 | `/compliance-profile` | Project onboarding / *Inception* | Rare | Engineer/lead | agent (auto) | Declare `hipaa`/`pci`/`gdpr`/`none` | `compliance.json` |
| 5 | `/sprint set <id>` | **Sprint planning** | Once per sprint | PM / scrum master | **type** | Record the active sprint | `current-sprint` |
| 6 | `/import-issues` | **Backlog refinement** → *Requirements* | Per sprint | PM or Engineer | agent (auto) | Pull the sprint's tickets from Jira (lean), group, flag thin ones | done-vs-pending list |
| 7 | `/align <ticket>` | **Backlog refinement** (PM+Eng) / start of dev (Eng) → *Requirements→Design* | Per feature/story | Refinement: **PM+Eng** · Pick-up: **Eng** | agent or type | Shared understanding + **acceptance criteria** (proportional) | `align.md` + criteria |
| 8 | `/to-prd` | **Backlog refinement** → *Design* | Per feature | PM/BA (or Eng) | agent (auto) | Alignment → short destination doc | `prd.md` |
| 9 | `/to-issues` | **Sprint planning** → *Design / task breakdown* | Per feature | Engineer / tech-lead | agent (auto) | Slice into **vertical slices**; push criteria + per-repo sub-tasks to Jira | Jira sub-tasks + `issues.md` |
| 10 | `/tdd` | **Sprint execution (daily)** → *Implementation+Testing* | Per task | **Engineer + AI** | agent (auto) | Failing test → minimal code → refactor → gate green | code + tests |
| 11 | `/phi-redaction-check` | **Code review / pre-merge** → *Testing/Security* | Per PR / demo | Engineer (ideally CI/hook) | agent (auto) | Scan for PHI/PII/secrets; **block** on a hit | pass / block |
| 12 | `/safe-logging` | Sprint execution → *Implementation (NFR)* | **Required on ePHI paths** | Engineer + AI | agent (auto, gated in `/tdd`) | Logs carry references, never PHI | PHI-safe logging |
| 13 | `/audit-logging` | Sprint execution → *Implementation (compliance NFR)* | **Required on ePHI paths** | Engineer + AI | agent (auto, gated in `/tdd`) | Record who/what/when accessed ePHI | audit trail |
| 14 | `/writing-great-skills` | **Retrospective** → *Continuous improvement* | Rare | Skill author | **type** | The authoring contract for a good skill | a well-formed skill |

*"type" = a human types it; "agent (auto)" = the AI can invoke it in-flow (you can also type it).*

## View B — The Agile cadence (ceremony by ceremony)

| Agile ceremony | SDLC phase | Commands | Who | Output |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Project onboarding** (pre-sprint, one-time) | Inception / Setup | `/start` → `/scaffold` or `/onboard` + `/compliance-profile` | Engineer/lead | repo is agent-ready: gate + profile + `CLAUDE.md` |
| **Backlog refinement / grooming** | Requirements → Design | `/import-issues` → `/align` (refinement) → `/to-prd` | **PM/BA + Engineer** | thin tickets become **ready** stories with acceptance criteria |
| **Sprint planning** | Planning / Design | `/sprint set` → commit refined stories → `/to-issues` | PM + Engineer/tech-lead | sprint backlog = **vertical slices** with blocking, in Jira |
| **Sprint execution (daily)** | Implementation + Testing | `/align` (pick-up, if a ticket is still thin) → `/tdd` (+ `/safe-logging`, `/audit-logging`) | **Engineer + AI** | working slices, tests, gate green |
| **Code review** | Quality gate / Security | PR + `/phi-redaction-check` | Engineer (reviewer) | merged, leak-free code |
| **QA / acceptance** | Testing | verify the **Given/When/Then** criteria in the app | **QA + PM** | sign-off |
| **Sprint review / demo** | — | demo the slices (each is demoable) | PM + client | client acceptance / feedback |
| **Release** | Deployment | CI/CD + `/phi-redaction-check` + audit check | Platform/DevOps | shipped |
| **Retrospective** | Maintenance / Improvement | `/writing-great-skills` (improve a skill from real friction) | team | a better harness next sprint |

## The one mental model

```
ONBOARDING (once)      →  /start → scaffold|onboard → compliance-profile
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
EACH SPRINT:
  Sprint planning      →  /sprint set
  Refine an item       →  /align <item>      ← reads the Jira TYPE and runs the right chain itself:
                            • Epic  → PRD on the epic + child user stories
                            • Story → acceptance criteria (+ slices if multi-part)
                            • Bug   → criteria → ready for /tdd
                          (you never call /to-prd or /to-issues by hand — /align orchestrates them)
  Daily dev (Eng+AI)   →  /tdd  (+ safe-logging, audit-logging)            ← AI writes, engineer judges
  Code review          →  PR + /phi-redaction-check
  QA                   →  verify acceptance criteria
  Review/demo / Release / Retro → your normal Agile
```

**The whole point:** the human picks the **item**, not the **command**. `/align` detects the level
(Epic/Story/Bug) and runs the right chain — so across 200 engineers nobody has to remember which command
fits. Realistically you touch just **two** verbs: `/align <item>` (refine, criteria → Jira) and `/tdd`
(build). `/to-prd`/`/to-issues` are sub-steps `/align` calls; `/phi-redaction-check` is the governance gate.

## How each step happens — alone vs. meeting

Most work is **async/solo**; meetings are few.

| Step | Setting |
|---|---|
| PM writes business story + acceptance criteria | **PM solo / async** |
| Backlog refinement | **meeting** — but only for sizable/ambiguous items (clear stories: PM solo) |
| Sprint planning (commit + estimates) | **meeting** (PM + eng + QA) |
| Engineer pick-up align, build, code review, QA | **solo / async** (with AI) |
| Demo / review, Retro | **meeting** (team, + client for demo) |

## Two `align` modes — and when feasibility happens

| Mode | Who | Does | Feasibility? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AUTHOR** | PM/BA | intent → **business** Given/When/Then; flag tech questions | **No** — flag only |
| **BUILD-PREP** | Engineer | ground in current code → add **technical** criteria | **Yes** — done here |

Business story → PM AUTHORs solo, engineer's BUILD-PREP is light. Technical ticket (bug/refactor/infra)
→ engineer drives. The builder must *inherit* the criteria before coding — a clear PM-written ticket
satisfies that **without a meeting**.

## Estimation & velocity (with AI)

- **Engineer estimates** (after BUILD-PREP) → **PM verifies** at planning → **velocity is re-baselined empirically.**
- Points no longer encode *coding time* — they encode **review + QA + integration + test/gate setup + ambiguity.**
  That's where time goes now (typing collapses; judging AI output + passing the gate doesn't).
- **Why the PM verifies:** the risk flips to *under-estimating review/QA*. A "2-hour" AI build can be a
  "1-day" review+QA on regulated code. The estimate must reflect the human-loop work, not the keystrokes.

## Where the LLM gets project context

Three layers, each with one home:
- **Architecture / code** → the repo **`CLAUDE.md`** (written by `/onboard-existing-codebase`; a *living*
  doc — update it when architecture shifts, e.g. in retro).
- **Product / domain** → a maintained product doc (personas, glossary) — for AUTHOR-mode criteria.
- **The actual current code** → `align` (BUILD-PREP) and `/tdd` **read live files at HEAD every time**,
  not a snapshot. So "only up to last sprint" is a non-issue **if you `git pull` and work in the live
  repo** (a stale clone is the only way it goes out of date).

### Specs / Figma / screenshots
- **Text spec** → acceptance criteria in the ticket + `align.md`.
- **Screenshots** → attach to the ticket (the agent reads images); store feature visuals in
  `.health-harness/sprints/<sprint>/<feature>/assets/`.
- **Figma** → the agent can't read a Figma *URL*. Either **export frames as PNGs** and attach, or wire a
  **Figma MCP** (dev mode) so the agent reads designs directly. For UI-heavy work, prefer the Figma MCP.
